#Graph study of CA-GrQc dataset (https://arxiv.org/archive/gr-qc)

##Graph properties calculated:
1. Display the number of nodes 
2. Display the number of edges 
3. Display the number of source nodes 
4. Display the number of sink nodes 
5. Display the number of isolated nodes
6. Display the number of bridge edges 
7. Display the number of articulation nodes 
8. Display the shortest path length distribution 
9. Display the diameter of the graph

Degree Distributions:

10. Display the in-degree distribution in the form of a table 
11. Display the out-degree distribution in the form of a table 

Connected Components:

For the original graph:
12. Display the size of the largest strongly connected component (SCC) and the size distribution of all SCCs

Considering the graph as an undirected graph:
13. Display the size of the largest weakly connected component (WCC) and the size distribution of all WCCs
